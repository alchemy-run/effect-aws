  description: `Performs exact string replacements in files. 

Usage:
- You must use your \`Read\` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. 
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the oldString or newString.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if \`oldString\` is not found in the file with an error "oldString not found in content".
- The edit will FAIL if \`oldString\` is found multiple times in the file with an error "oldString found multiple times and requires more code context to uniquely identify the intended match". Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use \`replaceAll\` to change every instance of \`oldString\`. 
- Use \`replaceAll\` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.
